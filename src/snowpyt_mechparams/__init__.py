SnowPyt-MechParams: Collaborative Python library for estimating mechanical
parameters from snow pit measurements.

This library provides methods to estimate various mechanical properties of snow
from standard snowpit observations including density, grain size, hardness, and
temperature measurements. Developed through collaboration between multiple
academic researchers and institutions in the snow science community.
